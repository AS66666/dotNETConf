# .NET Conf "Event-in-a-Box"
.NET Conf is a free, 3 day virtual developer event co-organized by the .NET community and broadcasted from Microsoft studios in Redmond, Washington. 

We do this every year, usually after summer. You can find more info on our website [www.dotnetconf.net](https://dotnetconf.net).

This repo contains creative and technical content for running a .NET Conf local event or watch party in your community as well as information on how to syndicate the broadcast on your own sites. Each year is a little different and there is a lot of technical content associated with the events each time so we've preserved them in folders by year.
